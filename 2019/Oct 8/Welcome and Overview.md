Quick talk on Open Source projects:

Why we chose this activity
(Free, learn new technologies, xxx)
https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/people-contribute-open-source-projects/
Gain experience from working on an existing codebase. Working at consulting companies will have you create projects from scratch but larger companies with existing apps/systems will get you working on existing codebases majority of the time. Both are very different experiences and you having experience in both will give you a leg up over other new coders on getting your first dev job.
Include contributions as part of your resume/portfolio. Open source means everybody can see the source, which includes commits and pull requests. Commits and pull requests showcase your coding style, documentation capabilities, and clarity when making commits. Employers are able to easily see your commits and assess them.
Giving back. Open source takes a lot of time from maintainers and a lot of helpful technologies we use today are open source (i.e. reactjs). If we’ve got the time, give back and make the world a better place so everybody can benefit from each other.
What we want people to get out of the experience
Set expectations, we aren’t expecting that they will complete all tasks. Just get as far as you can, learn, and have a great conversation
