# Welcome

This repository aims to hold all supporting information for Dev Together Madison events. We help early career devs gain the skills they typically learn the first few years of their dev career.

It also contains any workshop contents we've previously held for our group members. Please feel free to browse the `Learn` folder, as they've been structured so any new dev can read through them and apply the concepts through exercises we've captured in our `Issues` section.
