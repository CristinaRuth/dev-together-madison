# About Dev Together
We are a group focused on helping early career devs by pairing them with professional mentors through in-person, high-value, low-commitment events.

# Our Event Tonight

Tonight, we'll focus on attempting to make our first pull request against an open source project.

As a note, [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is also happening. It's an event where people are encouraged to contribute to open source. You can get a free shirt for making 4 pull requests in October. You can also get other swags per https://hacktoberfestswaglist.com/.

## What is Open Source?
Per Oxford:
>Denoting software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.

## Why contribute to Open Source?

1. **Learn patterns, new technologies, etc from working on an existing codebase.** Working at consulting companies will have you create projects from scratch but larger companies with existing apps/systems will get you working on existing codebases majority of the time. Both are very different experiences and you having experience in both will give you a leg up over other new coders on getting your first dev job. More experienced developers can also learn new patterns, technologies, and improve collaboration skills when contributing to open source project.

1. **Include contributions as part of your resume/portfolio.** Open source means everybody can see the source, which includes commits and pull requests. Commits and pull requests showcase your coding style, documentation capabilities, and clarity when making commits. Employers are able to easily see your commits and assess them.

1. **Give back.** Open source takes a lot of time from maintainers and a lot of helpful technologies we use today are open source (i.e. reactjs). If we’ve got the time, give back and make the world a better place so everybody can benefit from each other.

## Goal Tonight

The goal for tonight is to just get experience at attempting to contribute to open source. There are a LOT of articles out there on how to do this, and it can quickly get overwhelming.

Making a pull request towards a real open source project tonight, within a few hours, is a very tall goal. So please do NOT get discouraged if you are unable to accomplish this.

Just attempt to get as far as you can! Focus on the things you learned, and take away learnings, not failures. :)

Also, the most popular technology indicated in the interest form is Javascript, so we'll try to focus on that tonight. However, if it proves to be too difficult to find issues for this specific technology, please do feel free to tackle a different tech depending on your comfort levels.

## Pair Up
1. Mentors line up on the left. Mentees line up on the right.
2. Pam/Cristina will give a playing card to each Mentor/Mentee.
3. The Mentor/Mentee with the same number card are paired up.

## Pairing Time
1. Introduce yourselves.
1. Decide which computer to use for the pairing. Ideally, this computer will have the [Github.com](https://www.github.com) account, an IDE (e.g. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) already installed, and [Mobster](http://mobster.cc/) installed to faciliate the pairing process.
1. Sign up for [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), if desired.
1. If mentee is unfamiliar with making pull requests, decide together if it makes sense to go through it together and practice by following [these instructions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions). [Open Pixel Art](https://github.com/twilio-labs/open-pixel-art) is also an alternative project to practice on.
1. Find an issue you can work on together. (see finding an issue section below)
1. Read the `README.md` and `Contributing.md` (if it exists) to understand what the project is about and what types of contributions they’re looking for.
1. Fork/Clone the repo.
1. Run Mobster to track time at the keyboard
1. Pairing session: Switch keyboard every 5 minutes
1. Submit pull request (if applicable)

### Finding an Issue
1. Find an outstanding issue on an open source one of you use. Try to follow the dependency graphs and see if any of the dependencies need help. The dependencies tend to be smaller-sized, so they may be lower-barrier to understand.
1. Parse through the projects near the bottom of [hacktoberfest site](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). You can filter by your desired technology.
1. Parse through the projects listed on [awesome for beginners repo](https://github.com/mungell/awesome-for-beginners).
1. Parse through [issues](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abeginner&state=open&type=Issues) with the `beginner` label.
1. Parse through [issues](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aeasy&type=Issues) with the `easy` label.
1. Parse through [issues](https://github.com/search?l=JavaScript&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agood-first-bug&type=Issues) with the `good-first-bug` label.
1. Parse through [issues](https://github.com/search?l=JavaScript&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Astarter&type=Issues) with the `starter` label.
1. Parse through [issues](https://github.com/search?l=JavaScript&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aup-for-grabs&type=Issues) with the `up-for-grabs` label.
1. If you want something simpler that is in Ruby, you can help Dev Together by contributing to our [Google Sheets Pairing](https://github.com/mercedesb/google-sheets-pairing), which we use to pair people up for our regular pairing events.
1. [Transcripts](https://github.com/thechangelog/transcripts) typically has low-barrier issues people can work on.
1. If you're up for a challenge, parse through [issues](https://github.com/search?l=JavaScript&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22&type=Issues) with the `good first issue` label.
