# Open Source Night - Mentoring and Pairing
## Description
For this event, we are doing our first Open Source Night format with a focus on mentoring and pairing.

**Please bring your laptop to the event!**

Since the [Hacktoberfest event](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is also happening, we will encourage our participants to try and complete the challenge even after our event is over.

See our [meetup event page](https://www.meetup.com/DevTogetherMad/events/265072255/) for more details.
